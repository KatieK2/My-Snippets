My Snippets
===========

This plugin for Sublime Text 2|3 allows you to have quick access to your own commonly used code through a context menu instead of copy/pasting from files or some other coding library.

After installing you will need to edit the (Packages)/My Snippets/MySnippets.sublime-settings file.
Include the name and path for each folder that contains your library. Note that all sub-folders will also be automatically included.

Folders and files will appear in a context menu (Right click in windows) titled "My Snippets". Selecting a menu item will result in all text from the associated file being injected into your open document in place of the cursor(s) and any selected text.

The menu items are displayed with their exact file name, minus the extension. I recommend using descriptive file naming conventions. Note that file extensions are not needed, but I personally use them in my snippets for syntax highlighting when writing my snippets.

I created this Package for use in my professional website development where I am commonly re-writing much of the same code on a daily basis.

I have included some folders and a css sample file to demonstrate how this plug works.
